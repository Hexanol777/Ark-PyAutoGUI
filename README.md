# Ark-PyAutoGUI
This repository is used to contain a series of experimental files focused on the customtkinter and pyautogui modules in Python.
The script inside the gui is simple; it's controlled by the 'pyautogui.locateOnScreen()' function, and it looks to see if an image is present on the screen, If it locates the said images on the screen, it clicks on them and proceeds with the rest of the code.
Make sure that the 'Start' Button is present on the screen when running the GUI.
